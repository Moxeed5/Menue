TODO:

Finish writing methods for crud for other classes.

aka write crud method for menu items and users and I guess menu.

creating the crud for users will create the root node in firebase db.

Possibly add posts, or maybe wait until later. 

Once All end points are set up, start looking at using Nuxt and vue.

Later:

Implement sorting logic, auth, and posts.
